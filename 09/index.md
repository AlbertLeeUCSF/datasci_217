## Running System Commands

The `subprocess` module provides a powerful interface to run external commands:

```python
import subprocess

# Basic command execution
result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)

# Shell commands (use shell=True)
files = subprocess.check_output('find . -name "*.py"', shell=True).decode()

# Handling errors (more on this later)
try:
    subprocess.run(['nonexistent_command'], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Command failed with exit code {e.returncode}")
```

<!--
- Run system commands from Python
- Capture command output
- Handle command failures
-->

---

## Running System Commands (2/3)

Common subprocess patterns:

```python
# Running command and capturing output
def get_git_branch():
    result = subprocess.run(['git', 'branch', '--show-current'],
                          capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout.strip()

# Running command with input
def compress_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        proc = subprocess.run(['gzip', '-c'],
                            stdin=f,
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        return proc.stdout

# Running command with environment variables
env = os.environ.copy()
env['DEBUG'] = '1'
subprocess.run(['my_script.py'], env=env)
```

<!--
- Capture command output
- Provide input to commands
- Modify environment variables
-->

---

## Running System Commands (3/3)

Best practices and common pitfalls:

```python
# DON'T: Unsafe command construction
cmd = f"find {user_input} -type f"  # Command injection risk!
subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)

# DO: Safe command construction
subprocess.run(['find', user_input, '-type f'])

# DON'T: Ignore errors
subprocess.run(['risky_command'])  # Might fail silently

# DO: Handle errors properly
try:
    subprocess.run(['risky_command'], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    logging.error(f"Command failed: {e}")

# DO: Set timeouts for long-running commands
try:
    subprocess.run(['slow_command'], timeout=60)
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    print("Command timed out")
```

<!--
- Avoid command injection
- Handle errors explicitly
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Use logging for errors
-->

---

## Code Quality Tools: Linters (1/5)

A "linter" is a program that highlights potential errors before you even try running the code. There are linters for pretty much every language you can think of, even Markdown. For Python, the linter that I recommend trying is `ruff`. It is much faster than `pylint` and I find it gets "confused" less often about the code context.

```python
# Installing linters
pip install pylint ruff

# Running pylint
pylint my_script.py

# Running ruff
ruff check .

# Example pylint output:
************* Module my_script
my_script.py:10:0: C0303: Trailing whitespace (trailing-whitespace)
my_script.py:15:0: C0116: Missing function docstring (missing-docstring)
```

<!--
- Linters catch common mistakes
- Enforce coding standards
- Improve code quality
- Prevent bugs before runtime
-->

---

## Understanding Errors (2/5)

```python
# 1. Print Debugging
def calculate_total(items):
    print(f"Debug: items received = {items}")  # Debug print
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        print(f"Debug: processing item = {item}")  # Debug print
        total += item['price']
    return total

# 2. Interactive Debugging with pdb (advanced)
def process_data(data):
    results = []
    for item in data:
        breakpoint()  # Starts interactive debugger
        result = complex_calculation(item)
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

---

```python
# 3. Common Error Patterns
# NameError: Using undefined variables
def process_stats():
    total = count + 1  # count is not defined
    return total

# TypeError: Mixing incompatible types
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = "0"  # String instead of number
    for num in numbers:
        total += num  # Can't add number to string
    return total / len(numbers)
```

---

```python
# IndexError: Invalid list access
def get_first_elements(list1, list2):
    return [list1[0], list2[0]]  # Error if any list is empty

# KeyError: Missing dictionary key
def get_user_info(user_dict):
    return f"{user_dict['name']} is {user_dict['age']}"  # Error if keys don't exist

# ValueError: Invalid type conversion
def parse_user_data(data_str):
    user_id = int(data_str)  # Error if data_str isn't a valid integer
    return user_id
```

<!--
- Use print statements strategically
- Interactive debugging with pdb
- Common error patterns
- Debug step by step
-->

---

## VS Code Debugger (3/5)

See the docs at [https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging)

```python
# debug_example.py
def process_list(items):
    total = 0
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        # Set a breakpoint here in VS Code
        value = complex_calculation(item)
        total += value
    return total

def complex_calculation(x):
    # Step through this function
    intermediate = x * 2
    result = intermediate + 5
    return result

# Test data with potential issues
numbers = [1, 2, "3", 4]  # Bug: string in list
result = process_list(numbers)
```

## Try/Except Basics (4/5)

```python
def safe_divide(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Division by zero!")
        return None
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid types - {e}")
        return None
    finally:
        print("Division operation attempted")

# Example usage:
print(safe_divide(10, 0))       # Handles ZeroDivisionError
print(safe_divide("10", 2))     # Handles TypeError
```

<!--
- Handle specific exceptions
- Use descriptive error messages
- Implement cleanup with finally
- Return meaningful results
-->

---

## Exception Types (5/5)

```python
# Common built-in exceptions and when they occur
def demonstrate_exceptions():
    # IndexError
    list_demo = [1, 2, 3]
    try:
        value = list_demo[5]
    except IndexError as e:
        print(f"Index error: {e}")
    
    # TypeError
    try:
        result = "2" + 2
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Type error: {e}")
    
    # ValueError
    try:
        number = int("abc")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Value error: {e}")
    
    # FileNotFoundError
    try:
        with open("nonexistent.txt") as f:
            content = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"File error: {e}")
```
