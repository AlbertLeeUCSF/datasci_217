# Lecture 07: Data Visualization for Health Data Science

## Section 0: Introduction & Inspiring Examples

---

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- **Define data visualization** and explain its importance in health data science.
- Distinguish between **exploratory** and **explanatory** visualizations.
- Recognize key principles of effective visual design.
- Identify inspiring examples of health data visualization.

# What is Data Visualization?

- **Data Visualization**:
  - The graphical representation of information and data.
  - Utilizes visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps.
  - Makes complex data more accessible, understandable, and usable.

  #FIXME-{{Include a simple example comparing a data table with a corresponding visualization to illustrate how visuals enhance understanding}}

# Types of Data Visualization

## Exploratory vs. Explanatory

- **Exploratory Visualization**:
  - Used during data analysis to discover patterns and insights.
  - Interactive and flexible.
  - Supports hypothesis generation.
  - *Think of it as the "Sherlock Holmes" phaseâ€”you're investigating clues in the data!*

- **Explanatory Visualization**:
  - Used to communicate findings to others.
  - Focused on conveying a specific message or story.
  - Tailored to the audience for maximum impact.
  - *Time to become a "Data Whisperer" and tell the story hidden within numbers!*

---

# Importance of Data Visualization

- **Transforms Complex Data into Actionable Insights**
  - Simplifies large datasets.
  - Highlights trends and outliers.
  - *Because seeing is believing, especially when data wears a stylish chart suit!*

- **Enhances Understanding and Decision-Making**
  - Aids in explaining findings to stakeholders.
  - Supports evidence-based decisions.
  - *Helps you level up from data novice to data ninja!*

---

# Key Principles of Effective Visualization

- **Clarity**
  - Present information in an easily digestible manner.
  - *Just like cleaning your glasses helps you see better, clear visuals help your audience understand better!*

- **Accuracy**
  - Represent data truthfully without distortion.
  - *With great data comes great responsibilityâ€”don't let your charts become 'Darth Gator' (dark and misleading)!*

- **Effectiveness**
  - Ensure the visualization serves its intended purpose.
  - *Make your visuals as effective as a plot twist in your favorite thrillerâ€”surprising but makes perfect sense!*

---

# Discussion Prompt

Think about a time when a visualization helped you understand a complex concept:

- What made the visualization effective?
- How did it aid your understanding?
- Are there visualizations you've found confusing? Why?

*Feel free to share examplesâ€”even if it's that confusing pie chart that made you say "I can't even slice this!"*

- **Animated Bubble Charts**
  - Life expectancy vs. income over time.
  - Illustrated global health improvements.
  - *He didn't just present data; he made it dance!* ðŸ’ƒ

- **Gapminder Tools**
  - Interactive data exploration.
  - Made complex health statistics accessible and engaging.
  - *Turning stats into pop cultureâ€”data never looked so hip!*

## Florence Nightingale: The Rose Diagram

![bg right:40% 80%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Nightingale-mortality.jpg)

- **Coxcomb Chart (Rose Diagram)**
  - Visualized causes of mortality during the Crimean War.
  - Highlighted the impact of poor sanitary conditions.
  - *Proving that data visualization isn't just for the birdsâ€”even when it's called a "coxcomb"!*

- **Impact**
  - Influenced medical reform and sanitary practices.
  - Early use of data visualization to drive policy change.
  - *Nightingale: Saving lives with stats before it was cool.*

  #FIXME-{{Include a modern remake of Nightingale's Rose Diagram to show its relevance today}}

## Edward Tufte: The Pioneer of Data Visualization

![bg right:40% 80%](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PxiYFf6xrdo_ZrWVg3PhUg.jpeg)

- **Data-Ink Ratio**
  - Maximizing the proportion of ink used to present data.
  - *Less is moreâ€”think of it as the "Marie Kondo" approach to data!*

- **Chartjunk**
  - Eliminating unnecessary decorative elements.
  - *Say no to chartjunkâ€”because nobody needs a pie chart with 50 shades of gray!*

- **Clarity and Precision**
  - Advocated for minimalist design focused on the data.
  - *Data used to be shy; Tufte made it the star of the show!*

- **Notable Works**
  - *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*
  - *Envisioning Information*
  - *Beautiful Evidence*

  #FIXME-{{Include an example contrasting a chart with high chartjunk and one with Tufte's minimalist approach}}

## COVID-19 Dashboard by Johns Hopkins University

![bg left:60% 90%](https://systems.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Map-03-27-2020.png)

- **Real-Time Visualization**
  - Tracked global COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths.
  - *When the world pressed pause, this dashboard played on.*

- **Effective Use of Maps and Time Series**
  - Interactive and continuously updated.
  - *Bringing pandemic data to the masses faster than toilet paper flew off shelves!*

- **Global Impact**
  - Became a crucial resource for researchers, policymakers, and the public.
  - *Proof that in data we trustâ€”even more than in memes during quarantine!*

---

# Reflection

- How did these examples use data visualization to create impact?
- What common principles can you identify among them?
- How can you apply these principles to your own work?

*Remember, with the right visualization, you can be the "Avenger" of dataâ€”assembling insights to save the day!*
