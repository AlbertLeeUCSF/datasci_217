# Lecture 07 Outline: Data Visualization for Health Data Science

0. Introduction & Inspiring Examples

1. Data Visualization with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
   - Brief introduction to each package (1 slide)
   - Important methods (3-5 slides per package)
     - Explanation of methods
     - Structure for calling (data structure, required/optional arguments)
     - Code examples
     - Output examples (placeholders)

2. Design Principles for Effective Visualization
   - Concepts based on Tufte and Wilke
   - Good vs. bad examples
   - Applying principles in practice

3. Advanced Visualization
   - Plotnine (for students familiar with R)
     - Introduction and key features
     - Comparison with ggplot2
   - Command Line Visualization
     - Tools like Mermaid.js
     - Integration with Marp and Notion
   - Interactive and BI Visualizations
     - Tools like Plotly Dash, Streamlit
     - Brief demos or examples

**Note:** Sections 1-3 should have approximately 20 slides each

For the programming sections:
- Briefly introduce the package (1 slide)
- Cover all important methods with 3-5 slides:
  - Explanation of the method (0.5 - 1 slide)
  - Structure for calling it (expected data structure, required/optional arguments) (0.5 - 2 slides)
  - Code example (1 slide)
  - Output example (placeholder for now) (1 slide)
