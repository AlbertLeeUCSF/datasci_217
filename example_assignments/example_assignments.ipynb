    "## Question 4: Find Distant Cutsites in FASTA Data (30 points)\n",
    "File name: `find_cutsites.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "In molecular biology, restriction enzymes cut DNA at specific sequences called restriction sites or cut sites. Finding pairs of cut sites that are a certain distance apart is important for various genetic engineering techniques. Cutsites are often represented with a vertical bar (|) in the cut site sequence, indicating where the enzyme cuts the DNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "- Take cut site sequence \"G|GATCC\" for BamHI:\n",
    "- In the sequence dna=\"AAGG|GATCCTT\", the cut site starts at index 4\n",
    "- The enzyme would cut between G and T, resulting in \"AAGG\" and \"GATCCTT\".\n",
    "- So the cut would happen before dna[4], which we would count as it's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Python script that finds pairs of restriction enzyme cut sites that are 80-120 kilobase pairs (kbp) apart in a given FASTA file. Your script should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept two arguments: the FASTA file path (data/random_sequence.fasta) and a cut site sequence (e.g., \"G|GATCC\")\n",
    "2. Read the FASTA file and save the DNA sequence to a variable omitting whitespace.\n",
    "3. Find all occurrences of the cut site (specified below) in the DNA sequence.\n",
    "4. Find all pairs of cut site locations that are 80,000-120,000 base pairs (80-120 kbp) apart.\n",
    "5. Print the total number of cut site pairs found and the positions of the first 5 pairs.\n",
    "6. Save a summary of the results (example below) in the results directory as \"cutsite_summary.txt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This problem originally required searching for reverses, complements, and reverse complements. For simplicity, only use the cut site sequence as written (no reverse, no complement, definitely no reverse complement).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- When running the script, put the cut site sequence in quotes to prevent issues with the pipe character, e.g., \"G|GATCC\".\n",
    "- Remember to remove the `|` character from the cut site sequence before searching for it in the DNA sequence.\n",
    "- Consider using string methods like `.replace()` or `strip()` to remove whitespace from the FASTA sequence.\n",
    "- (optional, advanced) The `re` module can be helpful for finding all occurrences of the cut site in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
